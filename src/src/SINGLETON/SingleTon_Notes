✅ What is a Singleton?
The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application and provides a global point of access to that instance.

This is useful when:

You want to control access to shared resources (like a configuration class, database connection, logger, etc.)

You need exactly one instance of a class

✅ Explanation

Step	Description
private static Singleton instance;	Holds the single instance of the class
private Singleton()	Prevents direct instantiation using new
public static synchronized Singleton getInstance()	Lazily initializes the instance and ensures thread-safety
s1 == s2	Both variables point to the same object in memory
